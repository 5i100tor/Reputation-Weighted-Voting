# Hello World!

## About You

**What do you want to be called?**
**I would like to be called Victor.**

**What is one of your proudest accomplishments or favorite memories?**

**I just finished this 16-hour long solidity programming course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ). As a non-professional-hobby-coder it took me ages, but I finally did it.**

## About You and The Course

**What do you hope to get from the course?** i.e. what are specific things that you want to learn or accomplish by June 05, 2024?

**I would like to absorb every piece of information regarding web3 I possibly can, but much more importantly, I am looking forward to interacting and discussing with like-minded people.**

**What do you hope to give to the course?** i.e. what are specific things that you could do to support the instructors and students (while also supporting your own goals)?

**I can't really think of anything specific at the moment but I am ready for anything.**
